# Posts-Web-App


This repo is web app I created during CS52: Full-stack Web Development. The app allows a user to upload, edit, and delete posts. Includes authentication- a user can only upload if they are signed in. Frontend was built using React and Redux. The backend uses MongoDB to store post and user data and is stored on Heroku. I deployed the app using Surge; if interested in viewing the deployed app, contact me and I can provide the link.
